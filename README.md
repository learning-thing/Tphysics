# Circle 2d Hitboxes
---
Trying to make Circular hitboxes with Collision-detection in Raylib.

### This is:
#### - Unprofessionell
#### - Just for fun
#### - Work in Progress

At the moment this project is focused on making a 2d sandbox enviroment, planning to extend this system for 3d and more modular, maybe even a library.

Big Thanks to raylib! For making this alot easier to paly around with.
